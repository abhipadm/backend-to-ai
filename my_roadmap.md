* Use **Google Calendar or Outlook** to block 3 weekday slots + 1 weekend slot as recurring “Study Sessions.”
* Treat them like **meetings you can’t skip**.
* Set a 15-min reminder before study time.
* If you miss a week, use the dates above to know exactly where to pick up again.
* Use a **habit tracker app (Notion, Todoist, Habitica)** to mark off weekly goals.
* Public accountability: post weekly progress on LinkedIn.
