</p>


This repo documents my **structured learning journey (Oct 2024 – Feb 2025)** as I transition from a decade of backend/API development into **AI engineering**.  
It includes weekly notes, hands-on projects, and interview preparation material.

---

## 📅 Roadmap
This learning journey follows a week-by-week plan (20 weeks):

- **Weeks 1–4 (Oct 2024):** Python & AI Basics  
- **Weeks 5–8 (Nov 2024):** NLP & GenAI Fundamentals  
- **Weeks 9–12 (Dec 2024):** GenAI Projects & Agentic AI  
- **Weeks 13–16 (Jan 2025):** Interview Prep + Portfolio Polish  
- **Weeks 17–20 (Feb 2025):** Stretch Goals (Deep Learning, PyTorch)

👉 Detailed notes are in [`weeks/`](./weeks/)
